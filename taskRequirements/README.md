# Frontend Task

This codebase is a skeleton of a trivially simple "Ticketing System".

Check the PDF you received for more information about the task we'd like you to complete.

To run this application, run:

```
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Welcome to the Platformed Frontend Exercise! Thanks for making time to do this. We
strongly believe that this kind of exercise is the best way to learn if you’d be a fit for ou
team, and we hope that this and the follow-on interviews give you a good chance to assess
us as potential future team-mates too.
Guidelines
Aim to spend no more than a couple of hours on this exercise, we value a correct, partial
implementation more highly than a complete but incorrect one.
Please include any code comments you think are relevant as you go, they help us
understand your approach to the task.
A great solution will be aesthetically pleasing, intuitive and make sensible use of included
component libraries.

Submitting
Create a local Git repository to track your work, we suggest including Git commits and
messages as you progress, rather than creating one giant change at the end.
When you’re ready to submit, pack the whole repository into a Git Bundle with git bundl
create platformed.bundle and return it to us via the link in the email you received.

In frontend.tar.gz you’ll find a TypeScript application implementing a Ticket List for

trivial ticketing system. Instructions for running the application are included in the README.

Part 1

The application contains some mock data for a ticketing system, which is currently shown in
the UI in JSON format. We’d like you to replace the JSON with a simple user interface tha
displays the list of tickets and information about them.
We’re particularly interested in how you choose to design and lay out the UI, in the ‘fit an
finish’ of the final interface. You should use elements from the included libraries wher
possible (Chakra v3, Heroicons), and the design should be ‘ready for production’ - i.
something you would be happy to show to an end-user. Otherwise, you are free to design
the page as you see fit.
You should consider the kinds of user that might interact with such a ticketing system, and
how they may expect to use the page.
For this part, the user interface does not have to be functional (for example you’re no
expected to be able to create, edit or delete tickets).
If you’re unfamiliar with Chakra, you can check out the provided NavBar component to ge
an idea of how to use it.
Part 2
For part 2, we’d like you to add the ability to filter tickets by their “Priority” and “Stat
properties. Again, it’s up to you how to lay out and implement the filtering UI in a way that i
intuitive and easy to use.
